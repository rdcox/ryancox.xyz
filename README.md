# ryancox.xyz
My personal site containing my resume, CV, past projects, photos, and everything else. Currently hosted in AWS and available at [ryancox.xyz](http://ryancox.xyz/).  

Still very much under construction, but some things I hope to be able to do with this site are:

- [] Create a debonair landing page that instantly woos all those who gaze upon it
- [] Beef up my drab, basic HTML with a beautiful, modern Javascript UI (Probably Vue or React)
- [] Add some pages (or subsections) for:
  - [] My resume
  - [] My CV
  - [] Other cool stuff
- [] Configure HTTPS and an SSL cert so that I can sleep at night knowing that visitors to my site will no longer see "Not Secure" in their browsers
- [] Think of more items to add to this list...
